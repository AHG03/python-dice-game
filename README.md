Project Title: Dice Rolling Game
A simple console application that simulates rolling a pair of dice.

Project Description
This project was developed as part of a python curriculum to practice core programming concepts.
The application generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, displays the results, and aloows the user to repeat the roll.

Key Features and Concepts Learned
Random Number Generation: Used Python's built-in random module to simulate dice rolls.
User Input and Control Flow: Implemented a loop that continues rolling the dice until the user explicitly chooses to quit.
Functions and Modules: Organized the code into functions for rolling the dice and handling the main game loop.
Basic Console Output: Used print() statements for clean display of the dice results.

How to Run the Project
These instructions assume the user hasa Python installed and the repository cloned.

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/AHG03/python-dice-game.git
cd python-dice-game

Run the Script:
python dice.py

Follow the Prompts:
The program will prompt you to press a key to roll the dice and ask if you want to roll again.
